# Coq Course

This course offers a sneak peek into the amazing world of machine-checked proofs and programs.

## Overview

By the end of this class, you will know how to:

- Use the Coq proof assistant to write machine-checked proofs.
- Prove basic logical properties of data structures.
- Understand the fundamental relationship between proofs and programs.
- Recognize why machine-checked proofs are trustworthy and what they guarantee about programs.

## Course Content

- **Introduction to Coq**: Basics of the Coq proof assistant.
- **Proof Writing**: Techniques for writing machine-checked proofs.
- **Data Structures**: Proving logical properties of various data structures.
- **Proofs and Programs**: Exploring the relationship between proofs and programs.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Coq**: Follow the installation instructions from the [Coq official website](https://coq.inria.fr/download).
2. **Clone the Repository**:

    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
3. **Navigate to the Course Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd coq-course
    ```

## Running the Proofs

1. Open the Coq files in your preferred Coq IDE (e.g., CoqIDE, Proof General).
2. Step through the proofs using the IDE's features to understand the logical flow and correctness.
